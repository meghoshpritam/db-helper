## üéØ Motivation

Importing large SQL dumps often fails due to:
- Foreign key constraint violations
- Memory limitations with large files
- Lack of proper error handling and recovery
- No visibility into progress or errors

This tool solves these problems by providing intelligent chunking, dependency-based ordering, and detailed execution tracking.

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:meghoshpritam/db-helper.git

```

2. Run the executor:

# Without schema
node lib/sql-file-executer.js path/to/dump.sql
```
